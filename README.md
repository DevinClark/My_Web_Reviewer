# My Web Reviewer
TODO: Add better name
This is a very simple node.js application that allows me to easily test responsive web designs by generating screenshots at common resolutions. You can add more resolutions if you want. If I am missing some, feel free to submit a pull request. I plan on adding more features as I go along and use it more.

## Requires
* PhantomJs - `brew install phantomjs`
* Review - `npm install review`

## To Use
* Change the url to your url or add additional urls.
* `cd` into the project directory and run the application by typing `node app.js`.
* Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.
